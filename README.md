# Calculator
A simple Calculator program written in Java.
This program runs it the console. If you would like to contribute,
please update the .gitignore file so that you are not syncing any metadata.
I use eclipse as my IDE. If you use Eclipse you will not have to update the .gitignore.
Feel free to add any changed to the calculator. A GUI version will be added soon using JFrame.
